#My first website using bootstrap
I basically got all the css and html from https://startbootstrap.com/. 
I worked in this website with the "Agency" theme available on this page for free.

#Mixing this up with React
I had to replace the html code that doesn't work with React (f.e: class=" => className=")

#React Routes 
For the navigation I added Routes using ReactRouter, it can be found on App.js
